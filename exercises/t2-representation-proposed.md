### Exercise 1

The following numbers are represented in twoâ€™s complement using 6 bits.
Indicate their corresponding decimal value:
   * 100000
   * 010011

### Exercise 2

<html>
A computer has a word width that allows you to represent numbers in complement to two in the range [-234, 234-1]. Respond:
<ol type="a">
  <li>What is the number of bits that store the registers of this computer?</li>
  <li>How much KB of memory can address at most this computer?</li>
</ol>
</html>

### Exercise 3

Indicate the decimal value of the following numbers represented in the single precision IEEE 754 standard: 0xBF400000, 0x7F804000 and 0x00180000.

### Exercise 4

Represent in the single precision IEEE 754 standard the numbers 15 and 3,75.

### Exercise 5

Add the previous numbers represented in the IEEE 754 standard using the IEEE 754 representation.
